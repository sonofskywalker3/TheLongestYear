# The Longest Year

**Restore the Community Center within a single year — or the Junimos rewind the seasons and you begin again, a little stronger.**

A roguelite time-loop for Stardew Valley (PC).

**The Longest Year** turns Stardew Valley's first year into a roguelite loop. Each season asks you to give back enough of the land's bounty to the old Community Center hall. Fall short by a season's end and the Junimos turn time back to Spring 1 — the world resets, but the strength you've earned (and the power your offerings bank) can carry forward. Restore the whole Center inside one year to break the loop for good.

This is a **beta** (`0.10.0`). It is feature-complete for v1 and stable in testing; what it most needs now is feedback on **difficulty, pricing, and pacing**. See [Giving feedback](#giving-feedback).

## What's New in 0.10.0

A big stability pass on the season-end gate and loop reset, plus fixes from beta reports. Changes since `0.9.6`:

- **The season-end gate is reliable now.** Two opposite bugs are fixed: finishing every goal no longer occasionally *resets* you anyway (the donation ledger is now reconciled from the Center itself at day's end), and *failing* the 28th no longer advances you to the next season when you'd just finished the bus-repair Vault that same day.
- **No more double theme pick on reset.** A loop reset used to make you pick your weekly theme twice and silently discard the first choice. Fixed — you pick once.
- **The bus-repair (Vault) money goal counts correctly.** On remixed-bundle saves (the recommended setup) the Vault was numbered differently and the gate could never be satisfied — now the indices are read from your actual bundles. The Season Goals menu also shows the bus-repair goal in the same style as every other goal.
- **Artisan goods keep their value through the Junimo Stash.** A Smoked Legend (and wine, jelly, aged roe, honey, bait…) no longer comes back as a generic 57g item after a reset — flavor and price are preserved.
- **Villagers stay out of the abandoned Community Center** during a run instead of routing into it.
- **The mine elevator locks on reset.** You no longer keep elevator access to floors you reached last loop unless you actually bought the keep-elevator upgrade.
- **Weekly goals name the egg color.** A "Large Egg" (or "Egg") task now shows "(Brown)" or "(White)" in the quest log — the two colors are different Community Center items, so the goal tells you which one it wants instead of leaving you to guess.
- **An in-progress tool upgrade at Clint's no longer survives a reset** as a free upgrade.
- **Removed the stale "Rat Problem" quest** — the Center is already open from day one, so the vanilla investigation quest no longer appears.
- **Clearer Junimo Shrine.** The planning view now states that JP is spent when a loop resets or you win — not mid-run — so the shrine no longer reads as broken.
- **Weather:** each season is now guaranteed a special-weather day in week 1, replacing vanilla's always-on day-3 rain.

## Features

- **Seasonal time-loop.** Each season has a donation minimum. Miss it and the year unwinds to Spring 1.
- **Junimo Points.** Donations earn JP — scaled by rarity and by how late in the year you give. JP banks across loops.
- **The Junimo Shrine.** Spend JP on upgrades that let you hold on to some of what you gained: skill levels, tool tiers, recipes, buildings, a kept pet, and more.
- **Weekly themes.** Each week, pick a theme that grants a bonus and a paired liability. Plan around it.
- **Carryover surfaces.** A **Bundle Log** book that tracks each season's goals, a Cookbook and Craftbook to bank recipes, and a Junimo Stash chest that survives resets.
- **A real intro.** Lewis greets you on the porch; a Junimo explains the loop. Then the run begins.
- **Break the loop.** Finish the Center in a year to win — then keep playing or start fresh.

## Requirements

- **Stardew Valley 1.6+** (PC — Windows/Linux/macOS)
- **SMAPI 4.0.0** or newer
- A **new save** on the **Standard farm** (see [Limitations](#limitations-beta))

## Install

1. Install [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/) (4.0.0+).
2. Download the latest `TheLongestYear` release and unzip it into your `Stardew Valley/Mods` folder, so you have `Mods/TheLongestYear/TheLongestYear.dll`.
3. Launch the game through SMAPI.
4. **Start a new game on the Standard farm.** The farm-type and skip-intro options are managed for you — the mod's own intro plays in their place.

## How it works

- **The intro.** On a fresh game, Lewis greets you on the porch, then a Junimo explains the loop. You wake on Spring 1 and pick your first **weekly theme**.
- **Weekly themes.** Each week you choose a theme that grants a bonus and a matching liability (e.g. more forage on pickup, but the mines are closed). The planning hub opens at the start of each week.
- **Seasonal goals.** The **Bundle Log** book (click to open) tracks each season's required donations. Each season has a minimum you must donate to the Center before the season turns. **Miss it and the year unwinds to Spring 1.**
- **Junimo Points (JP).** Donations earn JP, scaled by rarity and by how late in the year you give (later seasons are worth much more). JP banks across loops.
- **The Junimo Shrine.** On every loop reset (and on a win), spend banked JP on upgrades that let you *hold on to some of what you gained* next loop — skill levels, tool tiers, recipes, buildings, a kept pet, and more.
- **Carryover surfaces on the farm.** A **Cookbook** (kitchen) and **Craftbook** (table) let you bank recipes to keep; a **Junimo Stash** chest preserves a few items across resets.
- **Winning.** Restore the entire Community Center within a year to break the loop. You can then choose to keep playing that run or start a fresh loop.

## Configuration

All knobs live in `Mods/TheLongestYear/config.json` (created on first run). The values most worth tuning during the beta:

| Setting | Default | What it controls |
|---|---|---|
| `Jp.CommonJp` / `UncommonJp` / `RareJp` / `VeryRareJp` | 1 / 3 / 10 / 25 | JP awarded per donated item by rarity |
| `Jp.SeasonMultipliers` | `[1.0, 1.5, 2.5, 4.0]` | Per-season JP multiplier (Spring→Winter) |
| `Jp.BundleCompletionBonus` / `RoomCompletionBonus` / `WeeklyQuestCompletionBonus` | 15 / 60 / 30 | Bonus JP for milestones (×season multiplier) |
| `StartingMoney` | 500 | Gold at the start of each loop |
| `BundleQuotas` | per-bundle | How much each percentage-bundle asks for |
| `StashTileX/Y` | `0,0` (auto) | Where the Junimo Stash chest is placed (`0,0` = auto-pick near the farmhouse). The Bundle Log / Cookbook / Craftbook are placeable furniture you can put anywhere. |
| `Enabled` | `true` | Master switch — turn the whole mod off to play vanilla |

Upgrade prices are defined in the shrine catalog (e.g. Cookbook/Craftbook tiers at 150 / 350 / 700 JP). Feedback on these is welcome.

## Limitations (beta)

- **PC only.** No Android port yet.
- **Standard farm only.** Other farm layouts put buildings in water and the stash off-map; the mod forces Standard on new games.
- **Start on a new save.** A run can only begin from a new game; other saves load normally and are left untouched.
- Intro cutscene and dialogue are a first pass.
- Multiplayer is untested.

## Giving feedback

What helps most right now:

1. **Difficulty** — do the seasonal minimums feel fair? Too punishing, too easy? Which season wall hit hardest?
2. **Pricing** — are JP earnings and shrine upgrade costs well-balanced? What did you save for first, and did it feel worth it?
3. **Pacing** — how many loops before the run "clicked"? Did the carryover make later loops feel meaningfully stronger?
4. **Bugs / crashes** — include your `SMAPI-latest.txt` (`Stardew Valley/ErrorLogs/`).

## Art wanted

The mod leans on vanilla sprites throughout. If anyone would enjoy making some custom **book / sprite artwork** (the Cookbook and Craftbook especially), I'd genuinely love to accept it and credit you. Drop a note in the comments.
