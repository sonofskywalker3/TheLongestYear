# The Longest Year — Status

**Last updated:** 2026-05-27 (after Plan 06 landed)
**Branch:** `feat/v1-plan-06-theme-effects`
**Tests:** 320 passing, 0 failing
**Build:** clean (0 warnings, 0 errors)

## What v1 means

Per the original design spec §14, v1 = "MVP — prove it's fun & stable on PC." Everything below
either ships in v1 or is explicitly deferred.

## Done

| Plan | Branch / commits | Shipped |
|---|---|---|
| **Plan 01 — Foundation** | merged | Core types: `MetaState`, `RunState`, `MetaStore`, `GameplayConfig`, `Calendar`, `Theme`/`Season`/`Rarity` enums, `JpSettings`. |
| **Plan 02 — Contracts** | merged | `RunManager`, `GateEvaluator`, `SelectionService`, `BundleCatalogBuilder`, `BundleGate`, theme/season classification, solvable-partition contract generator. |
| **Plan 03 — Lifecycle / reset** | merged | `WorldResetService` (in-place reset via `Game1.loadForNewGame`), `SaveBackup`, `WorldStateProbe` (leak test), `CommunityCenterUnlock`, `CcLocationAccessiblePatch`. |
| **Plan 04 — Donations + JP** | merged | `DonationService`, `DonationObserver` (Harmony-patched), `BundleCatalogBuilder` (catalog from `Data/Bundles`), `JpCalculator`, `UpgradePurchase` rule, `VaultRules`. |
| **Plan 05 — UI** | `feat/v1-plan-05-ui` | `WeeklyHubMenu` (planning hub), `JunimoShrineMenu` (upgrade shop), `MenuLauncher`, `SeasonGoalsBoard` (CC interactable), `UpgradeCatalog` + `UpgradePurchaseService`. |
| **Festival fixes** | `feat/v1-plan-05-ui` | Time flows during festivals, exit at real in-game time, auto-eject at festival end, HUD redraw during festivals, "Are you sure" suppression, day-8 hub unblock, day-3 forced rain removed, RNG re-seed on reset, Joja root-cause fix. |
| **Plan 06A — Persistence effects + per-stat keep upgrades** | `feat/v1-plan-06a-persistence-effects` | Wires `OwnedUpgrades` into reset effects (backpack, gold, kept coops/barns, kitchen, vault bus, horse, starting animals). Adds 80 chained keep entries (16 tool tiers + 2 rods + 50 skill levels + 12 mine elevator floors). Cap-not-grant via `PlayerSnapshot` (in-run peak captured pre-wipe) + `RunState.PeakMineFloor`. Profession picker re-fires for kept L5/L10 skills. Shrine UI hides locked entries. Generalised `MeetsMetaRequirement` (upgrade/quest/mail/season). |
| **Plan 06B — Cookbook + Craftbook** | `feat/v1-plan-06b-cookbook-craftbook` | 6 Carryover catalog entries (Cookbook/Craftbook I/II/III @ 150/350/700 JP, 5/10/20 slots). `CookbookMenu` + `CraftbookMenu` slot-grid IClickableMenus with sub-mode recipe picker (currently-known only) and confirm-remove dialog. `FarmHouse.checkAction` Harmony patches open menus on configurable tile coords (`tly_setcookbook`/`tly_setcraftbook`). `IndicatorRegistry` for reusable ?/! bubbles over world tiles. Quest intros via vanilla `Quest` on first reset after purchase. Recipe re-grant on `FarmerReset.Apply`. `MetaState` extended with `CookbookRecipes`/`CraftbookRecipes` (List<string>) + `DismissedIndicators` (HashSet<string>). |
| **Plan 06 — Theme effects layer** | `feat/v1-plan-06-theme-effects` | `ThemeModifiers` ids corrected to match signed-off spec (mines_closed / fish_bite_down / forage_off). `ActiveEffectsProvider` + `BonusDropResolver` Core types wired through `RunController` (Set/Clear on theme select + reset). 6 Harmony patch files implementing all 10 bonus/liability effects: forage_yield_up / forage_off / crop_growth_up / crop_growth_down / fish_bite_up / fish_bite_down / mine_drops_up / mines_closed / all_drops_up / all_sell_prices_down. `MixedSeedsPatch` injects Red Cabbage / Starfruit per cultivation upgrades (bool overload pinned). `fortune_rare_fish` gives +25% bite rate. `WeatherForecast` + `CartStockPreview` Core types deliver real foresight data to `WeeklyHubMenu` per owned Weather Sage / Cart Whisperer tiers. `tly_activeeffects` debug command. |

## Pending for v1

One block remains. After it ships, v1 is ready for a meaningful playtest.

### Plan 07 — Junimo Stash (user direction received, ready to plan)

Per design spec §9 + user direction 2026-05-27: "a specific chest with limited slots they can interact with anytime."

- World-object chest on the farm at a configurable tile (same pattern as cookbook/craftbook: `tly_setstash` debug command).
- Slot cap from existing `stash_1` (4 slots) and `stash_2` (8 slots) upgrades (already in Plan 05 UpgradeCatalog).
- Anytime interaction during run — reuse vanilla `Chest` UI with a Harmony slot-cap enforcement patch.
- Items survive reset — chest contents banked into MetaState on close + restored on next run start.

Status: design surfaced + signed off. Implementation plan not yet written.

## Deferred beyond v1

- **Cookbook/Craftbook Phase C (LY3)** — friendship per-NPC + wallet-flag per-item retention.
- **Cutscenes / full narrative** — placeholder text only in v1.
- **Endless victory-lap mode** — single-win run for v1.
- **Android port** — PC first.
- **Deep balancing pass** — calibrate numbers after v1 has been played.
- **Advanced contract modifiers** — per-run "blessings" etc.
- **SVE compatibility pass** — most pieces are SVE-safe already (see future-expansions notes).
- **LY2 / LY3** — Year 2/3 ultimate-perfection content, separate JP economies, possibly separate mods.

## Known playtest carryovers

From 06B:
- **Indicator `?` source rect** `(397, 489, 10, 10)` in `IndicatorRegistry` is approximate; visually verify the right sprite renders. One-line constant fix if wrong.
- **Indicator tile coords** start at `(0, 0)` (= disabled). After buying `cookbook_1` / `craftbook_1`, the player needs to run `tly_setcookbook` / `tly_setcraftbook` once each to anchor the interactable + bubble.

From 06:
- **`forage_off` over-suppression (JC-4)** — Mining liability also blocks weeds/stones via `spawnObjects`. Flag for playtest to assess if too punishing.
- **`fortune_rare_fish` is a 0.75× bite-rate multiplier (JC-2)** — v1 approximation for rare-fish boost (true rarity intercept requires deeper Stardew internals investigation).

## Small follow-ups (not blocking v1, can land any time)

- **Festival exit to host map.** Currently `Event.endBehaviors` warps to the farm entry; should land on the festival's host map (Town for Egg/Fair/Spirit's Eve; Beach for Luau/Jellies; Forest for Flower Dance). ~20 lines (`endBehaviors` postfix or transpiler).
- **Seed-driven weather scheduler** with per-season minimums. Spec'd in `TODO.md`.
- **Wipe-meta debug command** (`tly_wipemeta`). Trivial — replace `_meta.State` with `new MetaState()` + `_meta.Save()`.
- **Weekly Theme Journal entry.** Player-facing reminder + bonus-item completion tracking → liability suppression on completion. Spec'd in `TODO.md`.

## Workflow rules in effect

- Local commits only. Never push without explicit "yes, push".
- Co-Authored-By footer on every commit.
- Build/test/deploy: I do, user plays, I pull logs.
- Reserve playtests for MEANINGFUL feedback opportunities. Don't request a playtest just to confirm wiring fires — verify that solo.
- Run with `-p:EnableModDeploy=false` while Stardew is open (file-lock on the deployed DLL).
